    assistance for visually impaired users. After settling on Simulataneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), I added support 
    to an existing iOS application to allow 3D generation from images stores in the device's file system. I also integrated a 
    POC React Native project with an Objective-C/C++ native module, to simlutate the communication and build process required for integrating
    the mapping library with the clients current application.`,

    Using a public and private key allows all users to verify the validity of a tweet while only allowing a holder of the private key to correctly 
    sign a tweet. This will catch a remote takeover of an account, useful for celebrities or public figures. To implement, I wrote 
    scripts/functions leveraging JS crypto library to generate ECDSA key-pairs and create/verify signatures. I also developed a Node.js/MongoDB 
    back-end to manage public keys, allowing for end-to-end tweet verification.`,
